# Battle - A Side Project in Python
An RPG text-based, Dragon Ball-inspired game
Showcases use of object-oriented programming in Python, as well as a few but limited graphical capabilities
Ideas for future updates: make the game completely graphical, multiplayer, sounds and effects
Created following Nick Germaine's Python tutorial
